This review is more than just a list of books and movies. For me, reading and watching have always been ways to explore the world. I love sitting quietly in my room, letting my mind wander with the characters, sharing in their joys and sorrows. The journey is always fascinating and, in its own way, comforting. Stories have a sense of closure: adventurers return, mysteries are solved, and happy couples find their way to marriage. Reading feels like a game of chess‚Äîfinite in its possibilities, yet giving you a sense of control.

Over time, I‚Äôve read many books and watched countless movies. Writing this review is my way of revisiting those experiences and sharing them with you. I understand that some of these choices may not be to your taste‚Äîthey might feel too slow or overly long. Still, they‚Äôve left a mark on me, becoming part of who I am, and I want to include them here.

I hope you enjoy this journey with me ‚ò∫Ô∏è

## The Legend of 1900
![The Legend of 1900]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posters/the_legend_of_1900.png)

**Genre**: Drama

- [ ] Watched?

If you were to ask me about my favorite movie, this one would be one of those that  come to my mind. The story follows an orphan born on a cruise ship who grows up to become a piano prodigy. The film evokes a deep sense of nostalgia for the golden age of the early 20th century, enriched by jazz music and an overarching feeling of being adrift. I find myself resonating with the main character, 1900, who spends his entire life on the ship, never setting foot on land. His internal struggle‚Äîtorn between staying in the familiar confines of the cruise and venturing into the unknown‚Äîmirrors moments in my own life.

The movie features stunning cinematography and a captivating soundtrack. Originally released in 1998, it has been re-screened multiple times over the years. I highly recommend it :)

## Love Letter
![Love Letter]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posters/love_letter.jpg)

**Genre**: Romantic

- [ ] Watched?

Love letter is a Japanese movie directed by *Shunji Iwai*, shot majorly in Hokkaido. It's a story about secret love, loss, and healing. I watched it when I was a teenager who just started to understand and dream for love. The story is beautiful and touching, with poetic dialogues and cinematography. I always want to pay a visit to Hokkaido during the winter after watching this movie.

## District 9
![District 9]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posters/district_nine.jpg)

**Genre**: Sci-fi

- [ ] Watched?

This movie is regarded as one of the must-watch sci-fi films. I included it because it reminds of me our discussion about Europe's migration dilemma. The story begins when a population of sick and malnourished aliens is discovered aboard a spaceship that appears over South Africa. The government confines them to an internment camp called District 9. Twenty years after, a bureaucrat named Wikus is tasked with overseeing the relocation of the aliens, only to become deeply entangled in the unfolding conflict in unexpected ways.

The movie explored themes of  humanity, xenophobia and social segregation in a compelling way. It's unsettling to see how fear drives people to harm one another. But I believe that bringing up these issues and being aware of our irrational instincts will help to build a more compassionate world :)

## Alita: Battle Angel
![Alita: Battle Angel]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posters/alita.png)

**Genre**: Sci-fi

- [ ] Watched?

It's a little embarrassed to tell people that I thought Alita was the best sci-fi anime I've seen in the recent years. It is developed to be entertaining, but I do believe the story's background, as long as some dialogues, are thought-provoking. The movie also adopted state-of-the-art technology to create the character Alita. I've seen a teaser of Alita's eyes and was amazed by the details. They used CGI technique, where they canned human eyes to create the geometry of each layer, including the iris and pupil, then adjusted it to achieve the manga-like look. The result is stunning. I think it's a good movie both for entertainment, appreciation of technology, and for thinking about bionic ethics.

## Chicago
![Chicago]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posters/chicago.png)

**Genre**: Musical

- [ ] Watched?

Chicago is based on a Broadway musical of the same name. It's a story about two female criminals accused of murder with the help of a shrewd lawyer and under the influence of press. The story is set in 1920s Chicago, which is know as the Jazz Age. Interestingly, the musical is based on a earlier play written by the journalist who reported the acutal criminals and crimes. The story is meant to be a satire of the concept of "celebrity criminal" and the biased juries. However, in my opinion, it somehow strenghthens gender stereotypes. 

In the early 1920s, Chicago's press and public became obsessed with women who killed their lovers or husbands. These cases were brought to the trial against a backdrop of chaging views of women in the Jazz Age. At that time, all Cook County juries were male. A lore arose that, in Chicago, attractive women could never be convicted.

It is always complex when comes to stereotype, which continuously update along with the society. On the otherhand, great artworks can persist on the stage for a long time. Chicago might be regarded as an innovative work back to 1920s, but now we are already in the fourth wave of feminism. It's interesting to see how the picture of women (and men, lawyer, prison guard, ...) are depicted in the movie and how it's different from today's perspective.
Lastly, I love the music and the dance in the movie. It's a great Jazz musical.

## Tick-Tick-Boom
![Tick-Tick-Boom]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posters/tick_tick_boom.png)

**Genre**: Musical

- [ ] Watched?

This musical-based movie is one of my secret favorites. I love it not only because of the songs and lyrics, but also because the story behind the scene, and the actors. 

The movie is an embedded narrative. It's about a young composer, Jonathan Larson, who is struggling to pursue his dream. Larson is the composer of the famous musical *Rent*, which won plentiful awards and is one of the most longevous Broadway shows. The movie is based on a musical that was written by Larson himself about his own life. More interestingly, it is directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who is also a famouse composer and actor, known for his musical *Hamilton*.
The story began in Larson's cramped apartment in New York City. I can still  recall the song he performed at the party he hosted in that tiny, dimly lit space (I absolutely loved Andrew Garfield's performance of it).Although life is tough, Larson and his friends are still fully passionate about their dreams, and made the best of their lives by singing, dancing, and laughing. The movie is a celebration of life, friendship, and art. It's a great movie to watch when you feel down or lost. It's a reminder that life is short, and we should cherish every moment and every person we meet.

Larson's life was even more dramatic than the movie. He died on the day of the first preview of *Rent*, due to sudden heart attack. He never had the chance to celebrate the success of his work, and to see how much it meant to the world. The movie is a tribute to him, and to all the dreamers who are fighting to make their dreams come true.

![love death + robot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posters/love_death_robot.jpg)

**Genre**: Sci-fi, Animation

- [x] Watched?

Love Death + Robots is a collection of short stories, each of which is animated in a different style, and only lasts for 10-20 minutes. Here're some episodes we liked:
- *S1 E1 Sonnie's Edge*: I'm captivated by the concept of "mind control". Moreover, I like the twist in the end. And, of course, I can‚Äôt deny that I think Sonnie is incredibly cool ü§≠
- *S1 E6 When the Yogurt Took Over*: Funny and thought-provoking. Especially think about the analogy between yogurt and AI.
- *S2 E3 Pop Squad*: East Asian government should really consider to adapt it into a Public Service Announcement for pro-child policy ü§£
- *S3 E1 Three Robots: Exit Strategies*: Three robots visiting the abandoned Earth and leaving sharp comments. A funny and sarcastic story.
- *S3 E2 Bad Travelling*: Michel's favorite. It is interesting to see how democracy can be used to serve self-interests. Moreover, seeing how the main character made his way is quite engaging.
- *S3 E3 The Very Pulse of the Machine*: My favorite. It's a poetic way to depict death and rebirth
- *S3 E9 Jibaro*: Don't watch it before bed. It's not a comforting story, but definitely has the highest quality of animation. The anime is a masterpiece, no matter from the clothing, digital art, movement, or sound effect. I'm particularly curious about the design of the sirren and knights' clothes. It looks like a mix of medieval European and something Oriental. Unfortunately I didn't find any review about it.

## One hundred years of solitude
![One hundred years of solitude]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posters/marquez.png)

**Genre**: Drama

- [ ] Watched?

This TV series is based on a famous novel by Colombian author *Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez*, which tells the multi-generational story of a Colombian family. Surprisingly, although Wikipedia describes it as ‚Äúone of the supreme achievements in world literature,‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt seem to be very popular in Germany üòâ

The book is renowned for its magical realism, weaving mysterious and sometimes hilarious stories that reflect real-life themes. I‚Äôve tried reading it two or three times but never managed to get past the first 20 pages. The TV show has received high reviews, so I‚Äôm hoping I can finally experience the story by watching it instead.

## My Brilliant Friend
![My Brilliant Friend]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posters/elena.png)

**Genre**: Drama

- [ ] Watched?

I read the series of books and loved them. The story is about two girls growing up in Naples, Italy. Their lives are intertwined and mirrored in many ways. At an early age, they went on different paths--Elena keep studying and Lila got married when she was 16. Although their lives diverged, they still stayed close and faced many challenges together. I believe the most beautiful part of the book is the friendship--it's complex, deep, and real. All female characters were given well-rounded protrayals. You can see their desires, their struggles, and their dedication to their dreams.
