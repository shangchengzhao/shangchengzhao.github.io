**Genre**: Romantic

Love letter is a Japanese movie directed by *Shunji Iwai*, shot majorly in Hokkaido. It's a story about secret love, loss, and healing. I watched it when I was a teenager who just started to understand and dream of love. The story is beautiful and touching, with poetic dialogues and cinematography. I always want to pay a visit to Hokkaido during the winter after watching the movie.

## Alita: Battle Angel

It's a little embarrassed to tell people that I thought Alita was the best sci-fi anime I've seen in the recent years. It is developed to be entertaining, but I do believe the story's background, as long as some dialogues, are thought-provoking. The movie also adopted state-of-the-art technology to create the character Alita. I've seen a teaser of Alita's eyes and was amazed by the details. They used CGI technique, where they canned human eyes to create the geometry of each layer, including the iris and pupil, then adjusted it to achieve the manga-like look. The result is stunning. I think it's a good movie both for entertainment, appreciation of technology, and for thinking about bionic ethics.

Chicago is based on a Broadway musical of the same name. It's a story about two female criminals accused of murder with the help of lawyers and press.

I read the book and loved it. The story is about two girls growing up in Naples, Italy. Their lives are intertwined and mirrored in many ways. At an early age, they went on different paths--Elena keep studying and Lila got married when she was 16. Although their lives diverged, they still stayed close and faced many challenges together. I believe the most beautiful part of the book is the friendship--it's complex, deep, and real. All female characters were given well-rounded protrayals. You can see their desires, their struggles, and their dedication to their dreams.
