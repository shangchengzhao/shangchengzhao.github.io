## I haven't watched this yet, but I heard it's good
### One hundred years of solitude

### My Brilliant Friend

I read the book and loved it. The story is about two girls growing up in Naples, Italy. Their lives are intertwined and mirrored in many ways. At an early age, they went on different paths--Elena keep studying and Lila got married when she was 16. Although their lives diverged, they still stayed close and faced many challenges together. I believe the most beautiful part of the book is the friendship--it's complex, deep, and real. All female characters were given well-rounded protrayals. You can see their desires, their struggles, and their dedication to their dreams.
